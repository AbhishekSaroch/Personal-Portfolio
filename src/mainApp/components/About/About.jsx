            Hi<span>ðŸ‘‹</span>, Iâ€™m Abhishek Sharma â€” a frontend developer
            passionate about building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web
            interfaces. With a background in Electronics and Communication
            Engineering, I transitioned into web development out of a love for
            creativity blended with logic.
          </div>
          <div>
            I specialize in React.js, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and HTML/CSS. My
            strength lies in turning ideas into fully functional, pixel-perfect
            components while keeping performance and accessibility in mind. I
            believe in writing clean, maintainable code and creating experiences
            that are as intuitive as they are engaging.
          </div>
          <div>
            Currently, I work as an SDE-1 at Prodsmiths, where Iâ€™ve contributed
            to real-world projects including a legal case management dashboard.
            From implementing reusable components to handling complex state
            logic and API integrations â€” Iâ€™ve learned to take ownership and
            build with confidence.
          </div>
          <div>
            Outside of work, Iâ€™m always trying to level up. Whether it's
            sharpening JavaScript fundamentals, exploring DevOps tools, or
            experimenting with side projects â€” Iâ€™m driven by curiosity and
            growth. I value consistency, simplicity, and design that respects
            the user.
          </div>
          <div>
            My goal is to join teams that build meaningful products â€” and to
            keep pushing myself to become a well-rounded developer who can
            contribute both in code and in culture.
